# NUMBER-SYSTEM
A SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF NATURAL, INTEGER AND RATIONAL NUMBER SYSTEMS USING HASKELL ALGEBRAIC DATATYPES.


IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL NUMBERS USES THE COMPLETENESS PROPERTY, THAT LEADS TO THE NOTION OF CONTINUITY. THIS PROPERTY CAN BE DESCRIBED IN SEVERAL WAYS: LIKE DEDEKIND'S CUT, DEDEKIND'S LOWER (UPPER) BOUND AXIOM FOR INTERVALS, CONVERGENCE OF CAUCHY'S SEQUENCES OR AS A EQUIVALENT CLASS OF INFINITY SEQUENCES OF DECIMAL DIGITS. THESE NOTIONS ARE HARD TO REPRESENT IN A FINITE DISCRETE STATE MACHINE, THUS CAN'T BE IMPLEMENTED IN COMPUTERS USING ALGEBRAIC DATATYPES. THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS (OR ANY BOUNDED SUBSET OF IT) IS UNCOUNTABLE.
